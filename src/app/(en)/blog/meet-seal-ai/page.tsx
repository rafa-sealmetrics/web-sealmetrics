    question: "What is Seal AI?",
    answer:
      "Seal AI is the private AI layer built into SealMetrics. It powers a natural-language assistant that answers questions about your analytics by querying your data, and it generates automated insights. Inference runs on European infrastructure only (Scaleway, Paris), retains no prompt content, and never trains any model on your data. It requires no setup: there are no API keys to create and no AI vendor account.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Seal AI send my data to the United States?",
    answer:
      "No. Seal AI runs inference exclusively in Paris, France, on Scaleway — a French company with no US parent. Because the data never leaves the EU and the provider is not subject to US jurisdiction, no international transfer occurs, so GDPR Chapter V (Standard Contractual Clauses, transfer assessments, the Data Privacy Framework) does not apply.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Seal AI train on my analytics data?",
    answer:
      "No. The underlying model (gpt-oss-120b) is open-weight and static — it does not learn from requests. Neither Scaleway, nor SealMetrics, nor the model's creator trains on your data. SealMetrics stores only token counters for quota and billing; prompt and response content is never persisted.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Seal AI different from using ChatGPT or Claude with my data?",
    answer:
      "Consumer and API AI tools from US providers route your data to US-jurisdiction companies, even when an EU region is available. Seal AI is private by architecture: EU-only inference, no US parent, zero retention, no training, and an open-weight model you could self-host. If you prefer a specific external provider, SealMetrics also supports bring-your-own-key — but Seal AI is the default so privacy doesn't depend on configuration.",
  },
  {
    question: "What can I ask Seal AI?",
    answer:
      "Anything you'd ask a data analyst about your traffic and conversions: how a period compares to the previous one, which channel or source converts best and why, what your bounce rate is, how devices break down, or why a metric moved. It answers by calling your real data tools and narrating the result — grounded in your numbers, not invented.",

              Analytics tools have been racing to bolt an AI chat box onto the
              dashboard. Most of them quietly route your data to a US AI provider
              to do it. We didn&apos;t want to be one of them — so we built{" "}
              <strong>Seal AI</strong>, the private AI layer inside SealMetrics,
              on a different premise: the AI should be as private as the analytics
              it explains.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-[1.5rem] font-medium text-text-primary mt-10 mb-4">
              What it does
            </h2>
            <p>
              Seal AI is an analyst you can talk to. Ask &quot;how did traffic do
              versus last month?&quot; or &quot;which of my top sources converts
              best, and why do you say that?&quot; and it answers in plain
              language — by actually querying your data, not by guessing. Under
              the hood it plans, calls the right data tools, reads the results,
              and writes them back as a clear answer with the occasional chart or
              table. It also produces automated insights on a schedule, so
              patterns surface without you asking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crucially, it&apos;s <em>grounded</em>: it narrates the numbers it
              retrieved from your account and is built to refuse to invent ones it
              didn&apos;t. We test that discipline continuously against ground
              truth pulled straight from the database.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-[1.5rem] font-medium text-text-primary mt-10 mb-4">
              Why it&apos;s private by architecture
            </h2>
            <p>
              &quot;Private AI&quot; gets used loosely, so here is exactly what we
              mean, and it&apos;s all structural:
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-3 pl-6 list-disc marker:text-text-tertiary">
              <li>
                <strong>EU-only inference.</strong> The model runs on
                Scaleway&apos;s infrastructure in Paris, and only there. Scaleway
                is a French company with a French parent and no US ownership, so
                it isn&apos;t subject to the US CLOUD Act.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No transfer, so no transfer problem.</strong> Because your
                data never leaves the EU and the provider has no US parent, GDPR
                Chapter V simply isn&apos;t triggered — no Standard Contractual
                Clauses, no transfer assessment, no dependence on the EU-US Data
                Privacy Framework surviving its next court date.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Zero retention, no training.</strong> Scaleway retains no
                prompt content by default; SealMetrics stores only token counts,
                never the content. The model is open-weight and static — it does
                not learn from your requests.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The prompt is born clean.</strong> SealMetrics is
                consentless analytics: we never collect IPs, cookies, or visitor
                identifiers in the first place. So there is no personal identifier
                to send to the AI, even before privacy controls apply.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The difference from bolting on a US AI API is not a stricter
              contract. It&apos;s that the data never enters a jurisdiction where
              a stricter contract would be needed.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-[1.5rem] font-medium text-text-primary mt-10 mb-4">
              No setup, and no lock-in
            </h2>
            <p>
              You don&apos;t configure anything. There are no API keys to create
              and no third-party AI account to sign up for — Seal AI is included
              and uses a platform-owned key you never see. If you&apos;d rather
              use a specific external provider, SealMetrics supports
              bring-your-own-key for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or DeepSeek. But
              Seal AI is the default on purpose: privacy shouldn&apos;t depend on
              a checkbox.
            </p>
            <p>
              And because the model is open-weight under the Apache 2.0 license,
              we&apos;re not locked to a single vendor either. The same model is
              available from several European hosts and can run on a single GPU —
              so the privacy guarantee is one we could keep even if we changed
              infrastructure. A guarantee you can&apos;t walk away from isn&apos;t
              a guarantee; ours is portable by design.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-serif text-[1.5rem] font-medium text-text-primary mt-10 mb-4">
              Try it with three questions
            </h2>
            <p>
              If you already use SealMetrics, open the assistant and ask: (1)
              &quot;Compare my entrances over the last 7 days to the previous
              7.&quot; (2) &quot;Which of my top 3 sources converts best, and
              why?&quot; (3) &quot;What&apos;s my bounce rate this month?&quot;
              You&apos;ll get grounded answers in seconds — and none of the data
              behind them will have left the EU.
